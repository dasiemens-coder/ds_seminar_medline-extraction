    "# MedlinePlus Data Extraction for DISNET\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project implements an automated data extraction pipeline to integrate phenotypic information from MedlinePlus into the DISNET platform. It systematically identifies disease-related Patient Handouts from MedlinePlus Health Topics XML, maps them to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) disease identifiers (CUIs), and extracts relevant symptom data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "The implemented pipeline includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **XML Parsing and Filtering**:\n",
    "   - Parse MedlinePlus Health Topic XML.\n",
    "   - Identify relevant Patient Handouts using Apache Spark, filtering by:\n",
    "     - `information-category` containing both \"Patient Handouts\" and \"Encyclopedia\".\n",
    "     - `organization` exactly matching \"Medical Encyclopedia\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Disease Mapping**:\n",
    "   - Extract Patient Handout titles.\n",
    "   - Map titles to UMLS CUIs using the UMLS API and verify disease categorization via the local UMLS Knowledge Base.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symptom Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Fetch HTML content for each Patient Handout.\n",
    "   - Extract the \"Symptoms\" section using BeautifulSoup by identifying specific HTML headers.\n",
    "   - Capture all paragraphs and bullet points within the Symptoms section.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Symptom CUI Mapping**:\n",
    "   - Map extracted symptom bullet points to UMLS CUIs.\n",
    "   - Verify if the mapped terms are symptoms using the UMLS API and Knowledge Base.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Data Structure\n",
    "Extracted results are stored in an Excel file structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column                   | Description                                                  |\n",
    "|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `site_title`             | Title of Patient Handout                                     |\n",
    "| `url`                    | Direct URL to the Patient Handout                            |\n",
    "| `disease_cui`            | UMLS Concept Unique Identifier of disease                    |\n",
    "| `disease_name`           | Standardized name of the disease                             |\n",
    "| `symptom_text`           | Textual description of symptoms                              |\n",
    "| `symptom_bullet_points`  | Extracted symptoms as bullet points annotated with CUIs      |\n",
    "\n",

They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: Occur many times a day Occur for weeks to months before being noticed Interfere with school and learning Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: Stop walking and start again a few seconds later Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: Wide awake Thinking clearly Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling , fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing Changes in alertness (consciousness) , such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures.
